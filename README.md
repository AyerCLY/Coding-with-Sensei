# Coding-with-Sensei
 Introduction to programming with Python

This is a project of mine to introduce coding to my friends who are keen to learn.
These mini-project are designed for fun and not meant to replace any publicly available courses.
The topics covered are not intensive and merely serves the purpose to inspire and get new people to start coding.

The programming language of choise is Python and will utilize the openSource Anaconda application - Spyder

More information will be posted here as time progresses.

Have fun programming!
